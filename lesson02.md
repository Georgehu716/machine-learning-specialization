# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning

"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." --- Arthur Samuel (1959)

machine learning algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

algorithms is just tools, the most important is how to **apply** it.

Practical advice for applying learning algorithms


## Supervised learning part 1

x -> y, map

input ---> output label

Learns from being give "right answers"

Regression: Housing price prediction, predict a number, infinitely many possible outputs.


## Supervised learning part 2

Classification: Breast cancer detection

predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories.

Two or more inputs.

supervised learning: learns from being given "right answers"
- Regression: Predict a number, infinitely many possible outputs.
- Classification: predict categories, small number of possible outputs.
